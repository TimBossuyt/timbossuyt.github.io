Hello, I'm Tim Bossuyt, a mechatronics engineer fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software. Basically, the magic that happens when code makes physical things move. 

This website serves as a living documentation of my side projects and a sandbox for my technical curiosity. You will mostly find me writing about embedded systems, additive manufacturing, drone technology, and the security implications of hardware interfaces. I firmly believe that the best way to understand a complex topic is to try and explain it to someone else. Though, let's be real: this is mostly documentation for "Future Me" so I don't have to relearn how my own code works six months from now.
